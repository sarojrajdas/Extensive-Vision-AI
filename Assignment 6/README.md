# Assignment 6

* You are making 3 versions of your 5th assignment's best model (or pick one from best assignments):
    * Network with Group Normalization
    * Network with Layer Normalization
    * Network with L1 + BN
* You MUST:
    * Write a single model.py file that includes GN/LN/BN and takes an argument to decide which normalization to include
    * Write a single notebook file to run all the 3 models above for 20 epochs each
* Create these graphs:
    * Graph 1: Test/Validation Loss for all 3 models together
    * Graph 2: Test/Validation Accuracy for 3 models together
* graphs must have proper annotation
    * Find 10 misclassified images for each of the 3 models, and show them as a 5x2 image matrix in 3 separately annotated images. 
* write an explanatory README file that explains:
    * what is your code all about,
    * how to perform the 3 covered normalization (cannot use values from the excel sheet shared)
    * your findings for normalization techniques,
    * add all your graphs
    * your 3 collection-of-misclassified-images
